# NFL-Power-Ratings
I used NFLfastR data to make an NFL Power Ratings system.  It measures how many points a team is better than another team is on a neutral field.  After all the games are over you can run the code and it will give you the updated rankings!  I also will post an updated excel file for each week.

I used offensive and defensive EPA/play and success rate over the course of the season.  I held more weight to the last six weeks of games and also adjusted each team of their schedule.  So far (as of Weeks 12-15) it is about 58%!
